              <p className="about__story-subtitle">
                In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and
                Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and
                purchase products. Buyers didnâ€™t want to be interrupted by ads,
                they wanted helpful information. In 2006, they founded HubSpot
                to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound
                marketing.<br></br>
                <br></br> Along the way, HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into
                a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create the
                frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today.
                Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot uses its customer
                platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of
                scaling organizations grow better.
